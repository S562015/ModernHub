## Working with Project Boards
It looks very helpful for organizing the entire project using Project boards. It allows us to easily breakdown the tasks and assign it to respective developer. And Lead or Manager can view the status of any task in the board without disturbing the developer and project development. It is easy for every developer to track the status of all tasks assigned to all the developers.
Boards also provide analytics part to assess the team performance. There is also a possibility for managers to create custom charts. Boards have filter options for filtering out tasks/issues based on tags.

## Applications of GitHub Projects and Kanban
The process of project is visually represented through GitHub Projects and Kanban boards. To reflect the many phases of the project, we may add columns with headings like Todo, Ready to work, In Progress, Testing, Completed. For various facets of a project, we can make separate tasks using GitHub Projects and Kanban. A team member may be tasked with each job. It makes it easier for the group to work together. Team members can offer updates, make comments, and pose questions about tasks. Agile concepts, which are suitable for iterative and incremental development, are the foundation of Kanban boards. 
We may divide up the project into smaller parts and concentrate on completing them quickly. Project management and version control are closely coordinated because of this connection, which provides a holistic view of the project.
